          <p className="py-2 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
            Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Molly, a software developer and former teacher
            with a passion for education and technology. I've taught
            kindergarten and worked as a learning specialist, where I honed my
            skills in creating inclusive and engaging learning environments.
          </p>
          <p className="py-2 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
            After transitioning into software development, I discovered a new
            avenue for making a positive impact. From coding innovative projects
            to exploring various programming languages and technologies, I
            thrive on the dynamic nature of this field.
          </p>
          <p className="py-2 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
            As a native New Yorker, I embrace diversity
            and creativity as invaluable assets. They've shaped my collaborative
            problem-solving skills and fostered an open-minded approach to my
            work.
          </p>
          <p className="py-2 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
            As a developer, I value continuous learning, collaboration, and
            creating user-centered solutions. Drawing from my background in
            education, I aim to bridge gaps, making technology accessible and
            impactful for all. I'm excited to connect with like-minded
            developers and innovators. If you're interested in exploring my work
            or discussing shared interests, feel free to reach out or check out
            my portfolio.
